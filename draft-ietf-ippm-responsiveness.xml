<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today's networks.
Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
it remains a common problem for the end users.</t>

<t>Everyone "knows" that it is "normal" for a video conference to
have problems when somebody else at home is
watching a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone.
However, there is no technical reason for this to be the case.
In fact, various queue management solutions
have solved the problem.</t>

<t>Our network connections continue to suffer from an unacceptable amount
of latency, not for a lack of technical solutions, but rather a lack of awareness
of the problem and deployment of its solutions.
We believe that creating a tool that measures the problem and matches people's
everyday experience will create the necessary awareness,
and result in a demand for solutions.</t>

<t>This document specifies the "Responsiveness Test" for measuring responsiveness.
It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user
experience specifically when the network is under working conditions.
The measurement is expressed as "Round-trips Per Minute" (RPM)
and should be included with goodput (up and down) and
idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called
lag, latency, or bufferbloat, has been recognized
as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in today's networks <xref target="Bufferbloat"/>.
Solutions like fq_codel <xref target="RFC8290"/>, PIE <xref target="RFC8033"/>, Cake <xref target="Cake"/> or L4S <xref target="RFC9330"/> have been standardized
and are to some extent widely implemented.
Nevertheless, people still suffer from bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Although significant, the impact on user experience can be transitory --
that is, its effect is not always visible to the user.
Whenever a network is actively being used at its full capacity,
buffers can fill up and create latency for traffic.
The duration of those full buffers may be brief:
a medium-sized file transfer, like an email attachment
or uploading photos,
can create bursts of latency spikes.
An example of this is lag occurring during a videoconference,
where a connection is briefly shown as unstable.</t>

<t>These short-lived disruptions make it hard to narrow down the cause.
We believe that it is necessary to create a standardized way to
measure and express responsiveness.</t>

<t>Including the responsiveness-under-working-conditions test
among other measurements of network quality (e.g., goodput
and idle latency) would raise awareness of the problem and
establish the expectation among users that their network providers deploy
solutions.</t>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>

<t>A word about the term "bufferbloat" -- the undesirable latency
that comes from a router or other network equipment
buffering too much data.
This document uses the term as a general description of bad latency,
using more precise wording where warranted.</t>

<t>"Latency" is a poor measure of responsiveness,
because it can be hard for the general public to understand.
The units are unfamiliar ("what is a millisecond?") and
counterintuitive ("100 msec -- that sounds good --
it's only a tenth of a second!").</t>

<t>Instead, we define the term "responsiveness under working conditions"
to make it clear that we are measuring all, not just idle, conditions,
and use "round-trips per minute" as the unit.
The advantage of using round-trips per minute as the unit are two-fold: First, it allows for a unit
that is "the higher the better". This kind of unit is often more intuitive for end-users.
Second, the range of the values tends to be around the 4-digit integer range which
is also a value easy to compare and read, again allowing for a more intuitive use.
Finally, we abbreviate the unit to "RPM", a wink to the
"revolutions per minute" that we use for car engines.</t>

<t>This document defines an algorithm for the "Responsiveness Test"
that explicitly measures responsiveness under working conditions.</t>

<t>This document imports terminology and concepts from <xref target="RFC9110"/>, such as requests
and response header fields and content.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="design-constraints"><name>Design Constraints</name>

<t>There are many challenges to defining measurements of the Internet:
the dynamic nature of the Internet,
the diverse nature of the traffic,
the large number of devices that affect traffic,
the difficulty of attaining appropriate measurement conditions,
diurnal traffic patterns,
and changing routes.</t>

<t>In order to minimize the effects of these challenges,
it's best to keep the test duration relatively short.</t>

<t>TCP and UDP traffic, or traffic on ports 80 and 443, may take
significantly different paths over the network between source and destination
and be subject to entirely different Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.
The traditional delay measurement tools use ICMP, which may experience even
more drastically different behavior than TCP or UDP.
Thus, a good test will use standard transport-layer traffic -- typical
for people's use of the network --
that is subject to the transport layer's congestion control algorithms
that might reduce the traffic's rate and thus its buffering in the network.</t>

<t>Traditionally, one thinks of bufferbloat happening in the network, i.e., on
routers and switches of the Internet.
However, the networking stacks of the clients and servers can
have huge buffers.
Data sitting in TCP sockets or waiting for the application
to send or read causes artificial latency, and affects user experience
the same way as in-network bufferbloat.</t>

<t>Finally, it is crucial to recognize that significant
queueing only happens on entry to the lowest-capacity
(or "bottleneck") hop on a network path.
For any flow of data between two endpoints
there is always one hop along the path where the capacity
available to that flow at that hop is the lowest among
all the hops of that flow's path at that moment in time.
It is important to understand that the existence of a
lowest-capacity hop on a network path and a buffer to smooth bursts
of data is not itself a problem.
In a heterogeneous network like the Internet it is
inevitable that there must necessarily be some hop
along the path with the lowest capacity for that path.
If that hop were to be improved by increasing its capacity, then some other hop would
become the new lowest-capacity hop for that path.
In this context a "bottleneck" should not be seen as a problem to
be fixed, because any attempt to "fix" the bottleneck is futile --
such a "fix" can never remove the existence of a bottleneck
on a path; it just moves the bottleneck somewhere else.
Arguably, this heterogeneity of the Internet is one of its greatest strengths.
Allowing individual technologies to evolve and improve at their
own pace, without requiring the entire Internet to change in
lock-step, has enabled enormous improvements over the years
in technologies like DSL, cable modems, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi,
each advancing independently as new developments became ready.
As a result of this flexibility we have moved incrementally,
one step at a time, from 56kb/s dial-up modems in the 1990s to
Gb/s home Internet service and Gb/s wireless connectivity today.</t>

<t>Note that in a shared datagram network, conditions do not remain static.
The hop that is the current bottleneck may change from moment to moment.
For example, changes in simultaneous traffic may result in changes
to a flow's share of a given hop. A user moving around
may cause the Wi-Fi transmission rate to vary widely,
from a few Mb/s when far from the Access Point,
all the way up to Gb/s or more when close to the Access Point.</t>

<t>Consequently, if we wish to enjoy the benefits of the Internet's great
flexibility, we need software that embraces and celebrates this
diversity and adapts intelligently to the varying conditions it encounters.</t>

<t>Because significant queueing only happens on entry to the bottleneck
hop, the queue management at this critical hop of the path almost
entirely determines the responsiveness of the entire flow.
If the bottleneck hop's queue management algorithm allows an
excessively large queue to form, this results in excessively large
delays for packets sitting in that queue awaiting transmission,
significantly degrading overall user experience.</t>

<t>In order to discover the depth of the buffer at the bottleneck hop,
the proposed Responsiveness Test mimics normal network operations and data transfers,
with the goal of filling the bottleneck buffer to capacity, and then
measures the resulting end-to-end latency under these so-called working conditions.
A well-managed bottleneck queue keeps its occupancy
under control, resulting in consistently low round-trip times
and consistently good responsiveness.
A poorly managed bottleneck queue will not.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="goals"><name>Goals</name>

<t>The algorithm described here defines the Responsiveness Test that serves as a means of
quantifying user experience of latency in their network connection. Therefore:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Because today's Internet traffic primarily uses HTTP/2 over TLS, the test's
algorithm should use that protocol.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
As a side note: other types of traffic are gaining in popularity (HTTP/3)
and/or are already being used widely (RTP).
Traffic prioritization and QoS rules on the Internet may
subject traffic to completely different paths:
these could also be measured separately.</t>
  <t>Because the Internet is marked by the deployment of countless middleboxes like
transparent TCP proxies or traffic prioritization for certain types of traffic,
the Responsiveness Test algorithm must take into account their effect on
TCP-handshake <xref target="RFC0793"/>, TLS-handshake, and request/response.</t>
  <t>Because the goal of the test is to educate end users, the results should be expressed in an intuitive, nontechnical form
and not commit the user to spend a significant amount of their time (it is left to the implementation to chose a suitable time-limit and we recommend for
any implementation to allow the user to configure the duration of the test).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness-under-working-conditions"><name>Measuring Responsiveness Under Working Conditions</name>

<t>Overall, the test to measure responsiveness under working conditions proceeds in two steps:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Put the network connection into "working conditions"</t>
  <t>Measure responsiveness of the network.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following explains how the former and the latter are achieved.</t>

<section anchor="working-conditions"><name>Working Conditions</name>

<t>What are <em>the</em> conditions that best emulate how a network
connection is used? There is no one true answer to this question. It is a
tradeoff between using realistic traffic patterns and pushing the network to
its limits.</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test defines working conditions as the condition where the path between the
measuring endpoints is utilized at its end-to-end capacity and the queue at the bottleneck link
is at (or beyond) its maximum occupancy. Under these conditions, the network connection's responsiveness
will be at its worst.</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test algorithm for reaching working conditions combines
multiple standard HTTP transactions with very large data objects according to realistic traffic patterns
to create these conditions.</t>

<t>This allows to create a stable state of working conditions during which the
bottleneck of the path between client and server has its buffer filled
up entirely, without generating DoS-like traffic
patterns (e.g., intentional UDP flooding). This creates a realistic traffic mix
representative of what a typical user's network experiences in normal operation.</t>

<t>Finally, as end-user usage of the network evolves to newer protocols and congestion
control algorithms, it is important that the working conditions also can evolve
to continuously represent a realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<section anchor="single-flow-vs-multi-flow"><name>Single-flow vs multi-flow</name>

<t>A single TCP connection may not be sufficient
to reach the capacity and full buffer occupancy of a path quickly.
Using a 4MB receive window, over a network with a 32 ms round-trip time,
a single TCP connection can achieve up to 1Gb/s throughput.
Additionally, deep buffers along the path between the two endpoints may be
significantly larger than 4MB.
TCP allows larger receive window sizes, up to 1GB. However, most transport stacks
aggressively limit the size of the receive window to avoid consuming too much
memory.</t>

<t>Thus, the only way to achieve full capacity and full buffer occupancy on those
networks is by creating multiple connections, allowing to actively fill the
bottleneck's buffer to achieve maximum working conditions.</t>

<t>Even if a single TCP connection would be able to fill the bottleneck's buffer,
it may take some time for a single TCP connection to ramp
up to full speed. One of the goals of the Responsiveness Test is to help the user
quickly measure their network. As a result, the test must load the network, take its measurements, and then finish
as fast as possible.</t>

<t>Finally, traditional loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms
react aggressively to packet loss by reducing the congestion window.
This reaction (intended by the protocol design) decreases the
queueing within the network, making it harder to determine the
depth of the bottleneck queue reliably.</t>

<t>The purpose of the Responsiveness Test is not to productively move data
across the network, the way a normal application does.
The purpose of the Responsiveness Test is to, as quickly as possible, simulate
a representative traffic load as if real applications were doing
sustained data transfers and measure the resulting round-trip time
occurring under those realistic conditions.
Because of this, using multiple simultaneous parallel connections
allows the Responsiveness Test to complete its task more quickly, in a way that
overall is less disruptive and less wasteful of network capacity
than a test using a single TCP connection that would take longer
to bring the bottleneck hop to a stable saturated state.</t>

<t>One of the configuration parameters for the test is an upper bound on the number of parallel load-generating
connections. We recommend a default value for this parameter of 16.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="parallel-vs-sequential-uplink-and-downlink"><name>Parallel vs Sequential Uplink and Downlink</name>

<t>Poor responsiveness can be caused by queues in either (or both)
the upstream and the downstream direction.
Furthermore, both paths may differ significantly due to access link
conditions (e.g., 5G downstream and LTE upstream) or routing changes
within the ISPs.
To measure responsiveness under working conditions,
the algorithm must explore both directions.</t>

<t>One approach could be to measure responsiveness in the uplink and downlink
in parallel. It would allow for a shorter test run-time.</t>

<t>However, a number of caveats come with measuring in parallel:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Half-duplex links may not permit simultaneous uplink and downlink traffic.
This restriction means the test might not reach the path's capacity in both directions at once and thus not expose
all the potential sources of low responsiveness.</t>
  <t>Debuggability of the results becomes harder:
During parallel measurement it is impossible to differentiate whether
the observed latency happens in the uplink or the downlink direction.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Thus, we recommend testing uplink and downlink sequentially. Parallel testing
is considered a future extension.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="achieving-full-buffer-utilization"><name>Achieving Full Buffer Utilization</name>

<t>The Responsiveness Test gradually increases the number of TCP connections (known as load-generating connections)
and measures "goodput" (the sum of actual data transferred across all connections in a unit of time)
continuously.
By definition, once goodput is maximized, buffers will start filling up, creating the
"standing queue" that is characteristic of bufferbloat. At this moment the test starts
measuring the responsiveness until it, too, reaches saturation.
At this point we are creating the worst-case scenario within the limits of the
realistic traffic pattern.</t>

<t>The algorithm notes that goodput increases rapidly until TCP
connections complete their TCP slow-start phase.
At that point, goodput eventually stalls,
often due to receive window limitations, particularly in cases of
high network bandwidth, high network round-trip time,
low receive window size, or a combination of all three.
The only means to further increase goodput is by
adding more TCP connections to the pool of load-generating connections.
If new connections leave the goodput the same,
full link utilization has been reached.
At this point, adding more connections will allow to achieve full buffer occupancy.
Responsiveness will gradually decrease from now on, until the buffers
are entirely full and reach stability of the responsiveness as well.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="avoiding-test-hardware-bottlenecks"><name>Avoiding Test Hardware Bottlenecks</name>

<t>The Responsiveness Test could be run from various devices which are either consumer devices
or internet infrastructure such as routers. Many routers are cost-sensitive embedded devices
optimised for switching packets rather than terminating TLS connections at line rate. As a
result, they may not have sufficient processing power or memory bandwidth to saturate a
bottleneck link in order to be a useful test client for the responsiveness test.</t>

<t>In order to measure responsiveness from these devices, the test can be conducted without TLS
over plain HTTP. Whenever possible, it is preferred to test using TLS to resemble typical
internet traffic to the maximum extent.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="test-parameters"><name>Test parameters</name>

<t>A number of parameters can be used to configure the test methodology. The following list
contains the names of those parameters and their default values. The detailed description of the
methodology that follows will explain how these parameters are being used. Experience has shown
that the default values for these parameters allow for a low runtime for the test and produce
accurate results in a wide range of environments.</t>

<section anchor="measuring-responsiveness"><name>Measuring Responsiveness</name>

<t>Measuring responsiveness while achieving working conditions is an iterative process.
Moreover, it requires a sufficiently large sample of measurements to have confidence in the results.</t>

<t>The measurement of the responsiveness happens by sending probe-requests.
There are two types of probe requests:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>An HTTP GET request on a connection separate from the load-generating connections ("foreign probes").
This probe type mimics the time it takes for a web browser to connect to a new
web server and request the first element of a web page (e.g., "index.html"),
or the startup time for a video streaming client to launch and begin fetching media.</t>
  <t>An HTTP GET request multiplexed on the load-generating connections ("self probes").
This probe type mimics the time it takes for a video streaming client
to skip ahead to a different chapter in the same video stream,
or for a navigation mapping application to react and fetch new map tiles
when the user scrolls the map to view a different area.
In a well functioning system, fetching new data
over an existing connection should take less time than
creating a brand new TLS connection from scratch to do the same thing.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Foreign probes will provide three (3) sets of data-points: First, the duration of the TCP-handshake
(noted hereafter as <spanx style="verb">tcp_f</spanx>).
Second, the TLS round-trip-time (noted <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>). For this, it is important to note that different TLS versions
have a different number of round-trips. Thus, the TLS establishment time needs to be
normalized to the number of round-trips the TLS handshake takes until the connection
is ready to transmit data. In the case that TLS is not being used, it is undefined.
And third, the HTTP elapsed time between issuing the GET
request for a 1-byte object and receiving the entire response (noted <spanx style="verb">http_f</spanx>).</t>

<t>Self probes will provide a single data-point that measures the duration of time between
when the HTTP GET request for the 1-byte object is issued on the load-generating connection and when the
full HTTP response has been received (noted <spanx style="verb">http_s</spanx>). For cases where multiplexing GET requests into
the load generation connections is not possible (e.g. due to only HTTP/1.1 being available), the TCP
stack estimated round-trip-time can be used as a proxy or substitute value.</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">tcp_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">http_f</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">http_s</spanx> are all measured in milliseconds.</t>

<t>The more probes that are sent, the more data available for calculation. In order to generate
as much data as possible, the Responsiveness Test specifies that a client issue these probes regularly.
There is, however, a risk that on low-capacity networks the responsiveness probes
themselves will consume a significant amount of the capacity. Because the test mandates
first saturating capacity before starting to probe for responsiveness, the test will have an
accurate estimate of how much of the capacity the responsiveness probes will consume and never
send more probes than the network can handle.</t>

<t>Limiting the data used by probes can be done by providing an estimate of the number of bytes exchanged for
each of the probe types. Taking TCP and TLS overheads into account, we can estimate
the amount of data exchanged for a foreign probe to be around 5000 bytes.
For self probes we can expect an overhead of no more than 1000 bytes.</t>

<t>Given this information, we recommend that a test client does
not send more than <spanx style="verb">MPS</spanx> (Maximum responsiveness Probes per Second - default to 100) probes per <spanx style="verb">ID</spanx>.
The probes should be spread out equally over the duration of the interval. The test client
should uniformly and randomly select from the active load-generating connections on which to send self probes.</t>

<t>According to the default parameter values, the probes will consume 300 KB (or 2400Kb) of data per second, meaning
a total capacity utilization of 2400 Kbps for the probing.</t>

<t>On high-speed networks, these default parameter values will provide a significant amount of samples, while at
the same time minimizing the probing overhead.
However, on severely capacity-constrained networks the probing traffic could consume
a significant portion of the available capacity. The Responsiveness Test must
adjust its probing frequency in such a way that the probing traffic does not consume
more than <spanx style="verb">PTC</spanx> (Percentage of Total Capacity - default to 5%) of the available capacity.</t>

<section anchor="aggregating-the-measurements"><name>Aggregating the Measurements</name>

<section anchor="for-the-tls-enabled-case"><name>For the TLS-Enabled Case</name>

<t>The algorithm produces sets of 4 times for each probe, namely:
<spanx style="verb">tcp_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">http_f</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">http_l</spanx> (from the previous section).
The responsiveness of the network connection being tested evolves over time as buffers gradually reach saturation. Once
the buffers are saturated, responsiveness will stabilize. Thus, the final calculation of network responsiveness
considers the last MAD (Moving Average Distance - default to 4) intervals worth of completed responsiveness probes.</t>

<t>Over that period of time, a large number of samples will have been collected.
These may be affected by noise in the measurements, and outliers. Thus, to aggregate these
we suggest using a single-sided trimmed mean at the <spanx style="verb">TMP</spanx> (Trimmed Mean Percentage - default to 95%) percentile, thus providing the following numbers:
<spanx style="verb">TM(tcp_f)</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">TM(tls_f)</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">TM(http_f)</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">TM(http_l)</spanx>.</t>

<t>The responsiveness is then calculated as the weighted mean:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Responsiveness = 60000 /
(1/6*(TM(tcp_f) + TM(tls_f) + TM(http_f)) + 1/2*TM(http_s))
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This responsiveness value presents round-trips per minute (RPM).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="for-the-tcp-only-case"><name>For the TCP-Only Case</name>

<t>If there are no TLS connections being used, then the notion of a normalised round-trip time for the TLS handshake does not apply.
Zeroes cannot be substituted for <spanx style="verb">tls_f</spanx>, as that will result in an artificially low responsiveness value.
Instead, the same principle of giving each contribution to the foreign RTT equal weight, and then giving the foreign and self RTTs
equal weights is applied.</t>

<t>The TCP-only responsiveness is therefore calculated as the weighted mean:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Responsiveness = 60000 /
(1/4*(TM(tcp_f) + TM(http_f)) + 1/2*TM(http_s))
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="final-algorithm"><name>Final Algorithm</name>

<t>Considering the previous two sections, where we explained the meaning of
working conditions and the definition of responsiveness, we can now describe
the design of the final algorithm. In order to measure the worst-case latency, we need to transmit
traffic at the full capacity of the path as well as ensure the buffers are filled
to the maximum.
We can achieve this by continuously adding HTTP sessions to the pool of connections
in an ID (Interval duration - default to 1 second) interval. This technique ensures that we quickly reach full capacity full
buffer occupancy. First, the algorithm reaches stability for the goodput. Once
goodput stability has been achieved, responsiveness probes will be transmitted
until responsiveness stability is reached.</t>

<t>We consider both goodput and responsiveness to be stable when the standard deviation
of the moving averages of the responsiveness calculated in the most-recent MAD intervals is within SDT
(Standard Deviation Tolerance - default to 5%) of the moving average calculated in the most-recent ID.</t>

<t>The following algorithm reaches working conditions of a network
by using HTTP/2 upload (POST) or download (GET) requests of infinitely large
files.
The algorithm is the same for upload and download and uses
the same term "load-generating connection" for each.
The actions of the algorithm take place at regular intervals. For the current draft
the interval is defined as one second.</t>

<t>In <xref target="goals"/>, it is mentioned that implementations may chose to implement a time-limit
on the duration of the test.
It is left to the implementation what to do when stability is not reached
within that time-frame. For example, an implementation might gather a provisional
responsiveness measurement or let the test run for longer.</t>

<t>Finally, if at any point one of these connections terminates with an error, the test should be aborted.</t>

<section anchor="confidence-of-test-results"><name>Confidence of test-results</name>

<t>As described above, a tool running the algorithm typically defines a time-limit for
the execution of each of the stages. For example, if the tool allocates a total
run-time of 40 seconds, and it executes a full downlink followed by a uplink test,
it may allocate 10 seconds to each of the saturation-stages (downlink capacity saturation, downlink responsiveness saturation, uplink capacity saturation, uplink responsiveness saturation).</t>

<t>As the different stages may or may not reach stability, we can define a "confidence score"
for the different metrics (capacity and responsiveness) the methodology was able to measure.</t>

<t>We define "Low" confidence in the result if the algorithm was not even able to
execute MAD iterations of the specific stage. Meaning, the moving average is
not taking the full window into account.</t>

<t>We define "Medium" confidence if the algorithm was able to execute at least MAD
iterations, but did not reach stability based on standard deviation tolerance.</t>

<t>We define "High" confidence if the algorithm was able to fully reach stability
based on the defined standard deviation tolerance.</t>

<t>It must be noted that depending on the chosen standard deviation tolerance or
other parameters of the methodology and the network-environment it may be that a
measurement never converges to a stable point.
This is expected and part of the dynamic nature of networking and the accompanying
measurement inaccuracies. Which is why the importance of imposing a time-limit
is so crucial, together with an accurate depiction of the "confidence" the methodology
was able to generate. The confidence score should be reported to the user as part of
the main results.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interpreting-responsiveness-results"><name>Interpreting responsiveness results</name>

<t>The described methodology uses a high-level approach to measure responsiveness.
By executing the test with regular HTTP requests a number of elements come into
play that will influence the result. Contrary to more traditional measurement methods
the responsiveness metric is not only influenced by the properties of the
network but can significantly be influenced by the properties of the client
and the server implementations. This is fully intentioinal as the properties of the
client and the server implementations have a direct impact on the perceived responsiveness by the user. This section describes how the different
elements influence responsiveness and how a user may differentiate them
when debugging a network.</t>

<section anchor="elements-influencing-responsiveness"><name>Elements influencing responsiveness</name>

<t>Due to the HTTP-centric approach of the measurement methodology a number of
factors come into play that influence the results. Namely, the client-side
networking stack (from the top of the HTTP-layer all the way down to the physical layer),
the network (including potential transparent HTTP "accelerators"), and the server-side
networking stack. The following outlines how each of these contributes to the responsiveness.</t>

<section anchor="client-side-influence"><name>Client side influence</name>

<t>As the driver of the measurement, the client-side networking stack can have a
large influence on the result. The biggest influence of the client comes
when measuring the responsiveness in the uplink direction. Load-generation will
cause queue-buildup in the transport layer as well as the HTTP layer. Additionally,
if the network's bottleneck is on the first hop, queue-buildup will happen at the
layers below the transport stack (e.g., NIC firmware).</t>

<t>Each of these queue build-ups may cause latency and thus low responsiveness.
A well designed networking stack would ensure that queue-buildup in the TCP layer
is kept at a bare minimum with solutions like TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT <xref target="RFC9293"/>.
At the HTTP/2 layer it is important that the load-generating data is not interfering
with the latency-measuring probes. For example, the different streams should not
be stacked one after the other but rather be allowed to be multiplexed for
optimal latency. The queue-buildup at these layers would only influence latency
on the probes that are sent on the load-generating connections.</t>

<t>Below the transport layer many places have a potential queue build-up. It is
important to keep these queues at reasonable sizes or that they implement techniques
like FQ-Codel. Depending on the techniques used at these layers, the queue build-up
can influence latency on probes sent on load-generating connections as well as
separate connections. If flow-queuing is used at these layers, the impact on
separate connections will be negligible.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="network-influence"><name>Network influence</name>

<t>The network obviously is a large driver for the responsiveness result.
Propagation delay from the client to the server as well as queuing in the
bottleneck node will cause latency. Beyond these traditional sources of latency,
other factors may influence the results as well. Many networks deploy transparent
TCP Proxies, firewalls doing deep packet-inspection, HTTP "accelerators",...
As the methodology relies on the use of HTTP/2, the responsiveness metric will
be influenced by such devices as well.</t>

<t>The network will influence both kinds of latency probes that the responsiveness
tests sends out. Depending on the network's use of Smart Queue Management and whether
this includes flow-queuing or not, the latency probes on the load-generating
connections may be influenced differently than the probes on the separate
connections.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="server-side-influence"><name>Server side influence</name>

<t>Finally, the server-side introduces the same kind of influence on the responsiveness
as the client-side, with the difference that the responsiveness will be impacted
during the downlink load generation.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="root-causing-responsiveness"><name>Root-causing Responsiveness</name>

<t>Once a responsiveness result has been generated one might be tempted to try to localize
the source of a potential low responsiveness. The responsiveness measurement
is however aimed at providing a quick, top-level view of the responsiveness
under working conditions the way end-users experience it.
Localizing the source of low responsiveness involves however a set of different
tools and methodologies.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, the Responsiveness Test allows to gain some insight into what the
source of the latency is. To gain this insight, implementations of the responsiveness
test are encouraged to have an optional verbose mode that exposes the inner workings
of the algorithm as well as statistics from the lower layers.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of additional information that can be exposed
in the verbose mode: Idle-latency (measured at the beginning from the initial connections),
achieved capacity on load-generating connections,TM(tcp_f), TM(tls_f), TM(http_f) and TM(http_l)
(and even their raw values), HTTP-protocol, transport protocol, congestion-control
algorithm used on the client-side, ECN or L4S statistics, IP version, ... and many more.</t>

<t>The previous section described the elements that influence
the responsiveness. From there it became apparent that the latency measured
on the load-generating connections and the latency measured on separate connections
may be different due to the different elements.</t>

<t>For example, if the latency measured on separate connections is much less than the
latency measured on the load-generating connections, it is possible to narrow
down the source of the additional latency on the load-generating connections.
As long as the other elements of the network don't do flow-queueing, the additional
latency must come from the queue build-up at the HTTP and TCP layer.
This is because all other bottlenecks in the network that may cause a queue build-up
will be affecting the load-generating connections as well as the separate latency
probing connections in the same way.</t>

<t>Beyond the difference in the latency of the load-generating connections and the
separate connections, another element can provide additional information: Namely
testing against different servers located in different places along the path will
allow, to some extent, the opportunity to separate the network’s path in different segments. For
example, if the cable modem and a more distant ISP server are hosting
responsiveness measurement endpoints, some localization of the issue can be done.
If the RPM to the cable modem is very high, it means that the network segment
from the client endpoint to the cable modem does not have responsiveness issues,
thus allowing the user to conclude that possible responsiveness issues are
beyond the cable modem.
It must be noted, though, that due to the high level approach to the testing
(including HTTP), a low responsiveness to the cable modem does not necessarily
mean that the network between client and cable modem is the problem (as
outlined in the above previous paragraphs).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="responsiveness-test-server-api"><name>Responsiveness Test Server API</name>

<t>The responsiveness measurement is built upon a foundation of standard protocols:
IP, TCP, TLS, HTTP/2.
On top of this foundation, a minimal amount of new "protocol" is defined,
merely specifying the URLs that used for GET and POST in the process of
executing the test.</t>

<t>Both the client and the server MUST support HTTP/2 over TLS.
The client MUST be able to send a request with a GET or POST method.
The client MUST send the GET without the "Accept-Encoding" header to ensure the
server will not compress the data.
The server MUST be able to respond to both of these
HTTP commands.
The server MUST have the ability to respond to a GET request with content.</t>

<t>The server MUST respond to 4 URLs:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A "small" URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 (OK) and 1 byte of content.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The server SHOULD specify the Content-Type header field with the media type "application/octet-stream".
The server SHOULD minimize the size, in bytes, of the response fields that are encoded and sent on the wire.</t>
  <t>A "large" URL/response:
The server must respond with a status code of 200 (OK) and content size of at least 8GB.
The server SHOULD specify the Content-Type header field with the media type "application/octet-stream".
The content can be larger, and may need to grow as network speeds increases over time.
The actual message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely download the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>An "upload" URL/response:
The server must handle a POST request with an arbitrary content size.
The server should discard the content.
The actual POST message content is irrelevant.
The client will probably never completely upload the object,
but will instead close the connection after reaching working condition
and making its measurements.</t>
  <t>A .well-known URL <xref target="RFC8615"/> which contains configuration information for
the client to run the test (See <xref target="discovery"/>, below.)</t>
</list></t>

<t>The client begins the responsiveness measurement by querying for the JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> configuration.
This supplies the URLs for creating the load-generating connections in
the upstream and downstream direction as well as the small object
for the latency measurements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery"><name>Responsiveness Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>It makes sense for a service provider (either an application service provider like a video conferencing service
or a network access provider like an ISP) to host Responsiveness Test Server instances on their
network so customers can determine what to expect about the quality of their connection to
the service offered by that provider.
However, when a user performs a Responsiveness Test and determines
that they are suffering from poor responsiveness during the connection to that service,
the logical next questions might be,</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>"What's causing my poor performance?"</t>
  <t>"Is it poor buffer management by my ISP?"</t>
  <t>"Is it poor buffer management in my home Wi-Fi Access point?"</t>
  <t>"Something to do with the service provider?"</t>
  <t>"Something else entirely?"</t>
</list></t>

<t>To help an end user answer these questions, it will be useful for test clients
to be able to easily discover Responsiveness Test Server instances running in various
places in the network (e.g., their home router, their Wi-Fi access point, their ISP's
head-end equipment, etc).</t>

<t>Consider this example scenario: A user has a cable modem
service offering 100 Mb/s download speed, connected via
gigabit Ethernet to one or more Wi-Fi access points in their home,
which then offer service to Wi-Fi client devices at different rates
depending on distance, interference from other traffic, etc.
By having the cable modem itself host a Responsiveness Test Server instance,
the user can then run a test between the cable modem and their computer
or smartphone, to help isolate whether bufferbloat they are experiencing
is occurring in equipment inside the home (like their Wi-Fi access points)
or somewhere outside the home.</t>

<section anchor="well-known-uniform-resource-identifier-uri-for-test-server-discovery"><name>Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) For Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>Any organization that wishes to host their own instance of a Responsiveness Test Server can advertise that capability
by hosting at the network quality well-known URI a resource whose content type is application/json and contains a valid JSON object meeting the
following criteria:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "version": 1,
  "urls": {
    "large_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/large",
    "small_download_url":"https://nq.example.com/api/v1/small",
    "upload_url":        "https://nq.example.com/api/v1/upload"
  }
  "test_endpoint": "hostname123.provider.com"
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The server SHALL specify the content-type of the resource at the well-known URI as application/json.</t>

<t>The content of the "version" field SHALL be "1". Integer values greater than "1" are reserved
for future versions of this protocol.
The content of the "large_download_url", "small_download_url", and "upload_url" SHALL
all be validly formatted "http" or "https" URLs. See above for the semantics of the fields.
All of the fields in the sample configuration are required except "test_endpoint".
If the test server provider can pin all of the requests for a test run to a specific
host in the service (for a particular run), they can specify that host name in the
"test_endpoint" field.</t>

<t>For purposes of registration of the well-known URI <xref target="RFC8615"/>, the application name is "nq". The media type
of the resource at the well-known URI is "application/json" and the format of the resource is as specified
above. The URI scheme is "https". No additional path components, query strings or fragments are valid
for this well-known URI.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dns-based-service-discovery-for-test-server-discovery"><name>DNS-Based Service Discovery for Test Server Discovery</name>

<t>To further aid the test client in discovering instances of the Responsiveness Test Server, organizations
wishing to host their own instances of the Test Server MAY advertise their availability using
DNS-Based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/> using conventional, unicast DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/> or multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/>
on the organization network's local link(s).</t>

<t>The Responsiveness Test Service instances should advertise using the service type <xref target="RFC6335"/>
"_nq._tcp".  Population of the appropriate DNS zone with the
relevant unicast discovery records can be performed
automatically using a Discovery Proxy <xref target="RFC8766"/>,
or in some scenarios simply by having a human
administrator manually enter the required records.</t>

<section anchor="example"><name>Example</name>

<t>An obscure service provider hosting a Responsiveness Test Server instance for their
organization (obs.cr) on the "rpm.obs.cr" host would return the following answers
to PTR and SRV conventional DNS queries:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
$ nslookup -q=ptr _nq._tcp.obs.cr.
Non-authoritative answer:
_nq._tcp.obs.crname = rpm._nq._tcp.obs.cr.
$ nslookup -q=srv rpm._nq._tcp.obs.cr.
Non-authoritative answer:
rpm._nq._tcp.obs.crservice = 0 0 443 rpm.obs.cr.
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Given those conventional DNS query responses, the client would proceed to access the rpm.obs.cr
host on port 443 at the .well-known/nq well-known URI to begin the test.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important. In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t>
      <t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t>
      <t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured to facilitate service discovery. Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard DNS queries. This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD.</t>

      <t>This memo presents the FQ-CoDel hybrid packet scheduler and Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm, a powerful tool for fighting bufferbloat and reducing latency.</t>
      <t>FQ-CoDel mixes packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic. It provides isolation for low-rate traffic such as DNS, web, and videoconferencing traffic. It improves utilisation across the networking fabric, especially for bidirectional traffic, by keeping queue lengths short, and it can be implemented in a memory- and CPU-efficient fashion across a wide range of hardware.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
      <t>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

    <date month='August' year='2022'/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>

    <title>Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) Internet Service: Architecture</title>

    <date month='January' year='2023'/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet applications to achieve low queuing latency, low congestion loss, and scalable throughput control. L4S is based on the insight that the root cause of queuing delay is in the capacity-seeking congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput.</t>
      <t>The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network. The aim is for L4S latency and throughput to be usually much better (and rarely worse) while typically not impacting Classic performance.</t>
